Data for exponential tapers. Equations for taper generated by hand using two different points and solving for a and b in the
equation y = ab^x.

Points used: Thru: (0.25, 5.779) and (3, 0.5)
                   (-0.25, 5.779) and (-3, 0.5)
                   
             Line: (0.25, 13.00275) and (3, 0.5)
                   (-0.25, 13.00275) and (-3, 0.5)
Reflect uses same taper as line.
