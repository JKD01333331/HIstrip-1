The data files here are from HFSS simulation results. The TRL standards are sorted below into sets, showing which standards are intended to be used together. In addition, each standard has its corresponding filename, HFSS file, and for thru and line standards, the length in mm. The length includes the connectors - to find the length without the connectors, subtract 19.04 mm from the given length.

Set One - Initial standard development.

Standard              Dataset Name     HFSS Name          Length

Thru                  cs1thru.csv      cs1thru            111.7632 mm    
Reflect(short)        cs1short.csv     cs1short    
Reflect(open-load)    cs1openload.csv  cs1openload
Line                  cs1line.csv      cs1line            122.4011 mm (0.25 wavelengths longer)

Set Two - Shorter TRL standards.

Line                  cs2line.csv      cs2line            239.418 mm (3.25 wavelengths longer)

Set Three - Even shorter TRL standards.

Set Four - Shortest set. Currently using this cal set.
