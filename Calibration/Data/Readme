The data files here are from HFSS simulation results. The naming and multiple data sets for each standard can be confusing. The TRL standards are sorted below into sets, showing which standards are intended to be used together. In addition, each standard has its corresponding filename, HFSS file, and for thru and line standards, the length in mm. The length includes the connectors - to find the length without the connectors, subtract 19.04 mm from the given length.

Set One - Initial standard development.
  
Thru                  Thru.csv      ThruBG             111.7632 mm    
Reflect(short)        Reflect.csv   ReflectBG3    
Reflect(open-load)    Openload.csv  ReflectBGresist
Line                  Line.csv      LineBG             122.4011 mm

Set Two - Shorter TRL standards.

Thru                  Newthru.csv   ShorterThru        101.1253 mm
Reflect               Newshort.csv  ShorterReflect      
Line                  Newline.csv   Shorter_LongLine   239.418 mm

Set Three - Even shorter TRL standards.

Thru                  Newthru2.csv  ShorterThru2       84.9950 mm
Reflect               Newshort2.csv ShorterReflect2
Line                  Newline2.csv  Shorter_Longline2  223.288 mm
