The data files here are from HFSS simulation results. The TRL standards are sorted below into sets, showing which standards are intended to be used together. In addition, each standard has its corresponding filename, HFSS file, and for thru and line standards, the length in mm. The length includes the connectors - to find the length without the connectors, subtract 19.04 mm from the given length.

Set One - Initial standard development.

Set Two - Shorter TRL standards.
