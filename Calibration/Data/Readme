The data files here are from HFSS simulation results. The naming and multiple data sets for each standard can be confusing. The TRL standards are sorted below into sets, showing which standards are intended to be used together. In addition, each standard has its corresponding filename, HFSS file, and for thru and line standards, the length in mm. The length includes the connectors - to find the length without the connectors, subtract 19.04 mm from the given length.

Set One - Initial standard development.

Set Two - Shorter TRL standards.

Line                  Newline.csv   Shorter_LongLine   239.418 mm (3.25 wavelengths longer)

Set Three - Even shorter TRL standards.

Line                  set3line2.csv Set3line2          138.154 mm (1.25 wavelengths longer)

Set Four - Shortest set.
