The functions in this folder are used to implement the Multimode TRL calibration procedure outlined in the July 2012 
"Multimode TRL Calibration Technique for Characterization of Differential Devices" paper written by Wojnowsky et al and
published in IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques.

The readme will be updated as more of the code is written and streamlined.
